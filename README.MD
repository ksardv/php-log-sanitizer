A lightweight, **framework-agnostic PHP library** for automatically masking sensitive data in logs. Useful for privacy compliance (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS) and secure debugging.

- âœ… Framework-agnostic â€” works with any PHP project
- âœ… Format-aware â€” supports plain text, JSON, XML
- âœ… Regex-based masking with override support
- âœ… Ships with secure defaults (emails, passwords, API keys, etc.)
- âœ… Configurable via external `mask.php` pattern file
- âœ… No Monolog or PSR-3 required
- âœ… Modern PHP 8.0+ (typed properties, constructor promotion)
